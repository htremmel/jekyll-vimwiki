# Vimwiki-Jekyll
Use vimwiki?  Would like more control of the output website?  Like a trilogy of rhetorical questions?  Welcome to Vimwiki-Jekyll.

    - Point to your vimwiki dir.
    - Point to your jekyll dir.
    - Run compile!
    - Bonus: gulp will optimize the page(s).
    - Will send the built site to your server.

Do I want this to also serve the site using nginx?  How can I make serving this easier?
